    <h3>Budgets Are Moral Documents</h3>
    <p>
      How an institution spends money shows you what it values. Look at the
      budget below to see what your university values and, perhaps more
      importantly, what it doesn’t. If you disagree, change it! If you want to
      add an expense, you have to reduce an expense somewhere else. Your goal is
      to make the budget reflect your values and get as close to balanced (zero)
      as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you’re done, you can export the budget you made and use it to
      advocate for budgetary changes at your university.
